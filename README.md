##Purpose:

This game is designed to differentiate between clinical populations with behavioral compulsions and healthy control (HC) populations.

##Gameplay Overview:

The player is presented with two options in the game:

Option A: High reward, high cost - always results in a net negative point balance.
Option B: Moderate reward, no cost - always results in a net positive point balance.
The gameplay is designed to assess the player's ability to accurately model both complex-deterministic and simple-deterministic environments, and to make the rational choice to maximize game rewards. Deviations from expected HC behavior may indicate an inability to correctly model gameplay.

A correlation between irrational behavioral choices and the presence of behavioral compulsions may suggest that an inability to correctly model complex environments underlies behavioral compulsions in clinical populations.

##Description:

###Instructions and Practice Rounds:

The player is first guided through a set of written instructions on how to play the game.
This is followed by a set of practice rounds to familiarize the player with the mechanics.

###Main Gameplay:

The game begins on the Home Screen, where the player chooses to enter one of two rooms.
Unknown to the player, these rooms correspond to Option A (high reward, high cost) and Option B (moderate reward, no cost).
Upon entering a room, the player earns a certain number of points.
Each room contains portals, with the goal of finding a way to the "escape" door.
The player navigates through these portals, which teleport them to different sections of the room, until they reach the escape door.
Depending on whether the room represents Option A or B, the portals may cause the player to lose points.
Once the player escapes the room, they return to the Home Screen to make another choice.

###Objective:

Throughout the game, the player monitors their point balance to determine the best room to enter.
The game consists of a set number of rounds (e.g., 15 rounds total).
Over multiple rounds, the player may develop a preference for a particular room.

###Analysis:

This preference is tracked and later analyzed to compare the behavior of HC populations with that of clinical populations.
