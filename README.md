# Dungeons and Portals Game

## Purpose:

The Dungeons & Portals Game is designed to differentiate between clinical populations with behavioral compulsions and healthy control (HC) populations.

The game tracks the player's ability to accurately model cost-benefit in complex-deterministic environments, and to make rational choices to maximize game rewards. 

Deviations from expected behavior may indicate an inability to correctly model cost-benefit of complex decisions. Correlation between irrational behavioral choices and behavioral compulsions may suggest that the inability to correctly model complex environments underlies behavioral compulsions in clinical populations.

## Gameplay Overview:

The player is presented with two options in the game:

- **Option A:** High reward, high cost - always results in a net negative point balance.

- **Option B:** Moderate reward, no cost - always results in a net positive point balance.

## Description:

### Instructions and Practice Rounds:

The player is guided through a set of written instructions on how to play the game.
This is followed by a set of practice rounds to familiarize the player with the mechanics.

### Main Gameplay:

- The game begins on the Home Screen, where the player chooses to enter one of two dungeons.
- Unknown to the player, these dungeons correspond to Option A (high reward, high cost) and Option B (moderate reward, no cost).
- Upon entering a dungeon, the player earns a certain number of points.
- Each dungeon contains portals, with the goal of finding a way to the "escape" door.
- The player navigates through these portals, which teleport them to different sections of the dungeon, until they reach the escape door.
- Depending on whether the dungeon represents Option A or B, the portals may cause the player to lose points.
- Once the player escapes the dungeon, they return to the Home Screen to make another choice.

### Objective:

- Throughout the game, the player monitors their point balance to determine the best dungeon to enter.
- The game consists of a set number of rounds (e.g. 10 rounds total).
- Over multiple rounds, the player may develop a preference for a particular dungeon.

### Analysis:

Player behavior and preferences are mapped to Bayesian inference models to discern group-level differences between HC populations and clinical behavioral compulsion groups.
